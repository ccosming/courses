Ron Hubbard solution\n\nNot to mention hard-core chemical pollution\n\nIf you think you're just away, you're in a mental institution\n\nAnd that's a heart felt shame\n\n'Cos everyone's crazy, everyone's the same\n\nSo, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?\n\n\n\nTime now to take you to a different place\n\nWhere peace lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space\n\nA groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace\n\nA never losing touch with the ocean's embrace\n\nDiviner than the dolphin, that there is none\n\n'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun\n\nNo one tells 'em how their life is run\n\nAnd no one points at them with a gun\n\nThey have a lot of love for every living creature\n\nThe smile of a dolphin is a built in feature\n\nThey be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher\n\nSomeday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you\n\n\n\nBack to the land of the police man\n\nWhere he does whatever he says he can\n\nIncluding hating you because you're a Jew\n\nOr beating black ass, that's nothing new\n\nTrigger happy cops, they just like to brawl\n\nThey use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all\n\nThey got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails\n\nFuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail\n\nSo support your police, support your local wars\n\nThat's the way to open economic doors\n\nWhy do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore\n\nWe assume the position to sell the ammunition\n\nWhat the fuck? It's the american tradition\n\nAlong with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen\n\nIsn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?"
